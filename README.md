# Movies-ETL

## Background
The goal for this project is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. To do this, one function needs to take in the three files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating dataâ€”and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements and Technology
Data Source: ETL Deliverable 1, ETL Deliverable 2 and ETL Deliverable 3
Data Tools: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin
Software: pgAdmin 4.26, Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Flask Version 1.0.2

## Overview
Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data (JSON)
Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle Data
Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
